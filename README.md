# BPMN Miner

A process miner implementation for BPMN. Based on Alpha and Heuristic miners, but it doesn't use Petri nets.

> **Note**: This implementation is not complete and may not work properly at all but maybe it helps. The algorithm is fragile. The code needs some cleanup. Feel free to contribute / modify it as you wish.
